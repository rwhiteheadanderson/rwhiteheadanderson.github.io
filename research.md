# Research
**[home](./index.md)** |

My current research interests include issues in wildlife ecology, with special attention paid to urban wildlife species and how they interact with and adapt to human environments. Specifically, my research seeks to quantify wildlife-road interactions by developing new techniques incorporating space and time dynamics as central analysis components. These methods are based in **time geography, spatial optimization, suitability modelling, network analysis, point pattern analysis,** and **movement analysis** theories and practice. Additionally, I apply these techniques outside ecological inquiries towards questions of **public health** and **sustainability.** Other research interests surround issues in **landscape ecology** with emphasis on quantifying habitat fragmentation in landscapes impacted by roads and other anthropogenic disturbances. This research is conducted in efforts to better quantify habitat fragmentation; developments thus far include a series of original road-based landscape metrics, enabling more accurate fragmentation measures over multiple spatio-temporal scales.

There is a growing need to address the effects of roadway presence on wildlife. My research quantifies contact between humans and wildlife and develops better methods for mitigating these types of conflicts from two angles: habitat connectivity and wildlife movement. In doing so I have created new, more accurate methods rooted in the fields of landscape ecology and time geography that explicitly address wildlife-road interactions. In the future I would like to extend this work towards additional research tasked with providing actionable information on how, where, and when animal-road encounters might occur in efforts to minimize the effects transportation networks have on wildlife.
