# About Me
**[Home](./index.md)** |

About Myself:

I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Oklahoma Geography and Environmental Sustainability department. I identify as both a GIScientist and ecologist; my research agenda centers on the use of Geographic Information Systems for treatment of ecological research questions. My methodological focus is on spatial analysis and modeling of ecological systems; particularly the interactions between human activities and wildlife and the development of GIS-based strategies for mitigating related conflicts. The primary goal of my work is to transform the way wildlife ecologists and land managers measure and mitigate the impact of roads on wildlife.
