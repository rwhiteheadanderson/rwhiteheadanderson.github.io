# Service
**[Home](./index.md)** |

I have taken an active role in several professional service appointments. At the professional level, I am a reviewer for several refereed journals (see below) and am on the Editorial Board for the Southestern Geographer. I play a variety of roles in organizing conferences both nationally and locally for the **American Association of Geographers (AAG)**, including serving as the current **Chair of the Applied Geography Specialty Group (AGSG)**. At the University of Oklahoma I serve on a subcommittee for Faculty Senate and the OU GIS day organizing committee. At the department level I am active on the undergraduate committee, GTU honor society advisor, and am the current GIS club faculty advisor.
